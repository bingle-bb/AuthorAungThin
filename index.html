        "When Thayet Taung Broke" is a true-life adventure book by Burmese
        author Aung Thin, first published in September 2013 by Zun Pwint
        Bookstore. The book recounts Aung Thin's arrest during the 1949 Color
        Rebellion and his time in various prisons, including Magway,
        Taungdwingyi, Pyidaungsu, and Thayet Prison. In November 1949, he
        escaped Thayet Prison with fellow prisoners Ko Tain Maung and Ko Aung
        Kyi. The content is divided into three parts: His arrival at Thayet
        Prison, life inside, and the escape attempt. His journey toward
        Taungdwingyi. His travels from Taungdwingyi to Yenangyaung.
